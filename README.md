meteor-angular-filesaver
===================

A smart package that provides filesaver.js to the angular Meteor client.  Currently using version marked '2015-03-04'.

FileSaver.js implements the HTML5 W3C `saveAs()` [FileSaver][1] interface in 
browsers that do not natively support it. There is a [FileSaver.js demo][2] 
that demonstrates saving various media types.

FileSaver.js is the solution to saving files on the client-side, and is perfect
for webapps that need to generate files, or for saving sensitive information 
that shouldn't be sent to an external server.
